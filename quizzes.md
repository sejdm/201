1. Consider a curve parametrized by some $\gamma : (-1, 1) \to \mathbb{R}^2$. For what values of $t$ in the interval $(-1. 1)$ will $\dot{\gamma}(t)$ and $\ddot{\gamma}(t)$ be orthogonal if its arc length function, written in terms of the parametrization $\gamma$, is 

	a) $s(t) = t$
	b) $s(t) = t^2$

2. Consider a curve parametrized by $\gamma : (-1, 1) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ which has the property that $\ddot{\gamma}(t_0) = c \dot{\gamma}(t_0)$, for some real number c and some $t_0 \in (-1, 1)$. What is the curvature of the curve at the point $\gamma(t_0)$? Justify your answer.

3. If all the tangent lines to a space curve pass through a fixed point $c$, then prove that the curve lies on a straight line.

4. 
	a) Consider the function $F(x, y, z) = 2x^2 + y^2 -3 z^2 - 1$.
Compute the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$, and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}$.

	b) For the same $F$ as above, compute $\nabla F$. Why is $S := \{(x, y, z) \ |\ F(x, y, z) = 0\}$ a surface?


5. Given a surface patch $\sigma(x, y) = (x, y, \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2})$, compute the standard unit normal at the point (0, 0, 1).


6. If for every point on a surface patch $\sigma:U \to S$ of a surface, $S$, the two principle curvatures are equal, then prove that the principle curvature is constant.
