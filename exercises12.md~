% Practice problem set 12

1. Consider a plane intersecting a surface $S$. If the plane is perpendicular to the tangent space of $S$ at a point lying on the plane, then the intersection is a curve that is called a normal section of the surface. Prove that such a curve has zero geodesic curvature.

1. Generalize the previous exercise as follows: assume that the plane is not perpendicular, but makes an angle $\theta$ wih the tangent plane at $S$. Prove that curvature of the curve of intersection is $\kappa_n/\mathrm{sin}(\theta)$. What about the geodesic curvature?

1. Compute the normal curvature of any curve on the sphere. Can you interpret the answer physically?

1. Compute the geodesic curvature of any circle on a sphere. (A circle on the sphere can always be obtained by intersecting it with a plane.)

1. Compute the second fundamental form, principle curvatures, and the Gaussian curvature of a surface of revolution. Remember that its surface patch is $\sigma(x, y) = (f(x)\mathrm{cos}(y), f(x) \mathrm{sin}(y), g(y))$

1. If you are familiar with the characteristic polynomial, minimal polynomial, and the Cayley Hamilton theorem, then prove that $\mathcal{W}_{p,S}^2 - 2 H \mathcal{W}_{p,S} + K = 0$.

1. Prove that the Gussian and mean curvatures are smooth functions. This will need you to recall the way we defined smooth functions on a surface.

1. Remember that $\kappa_n=\langle \dot{\gamma}, \rangle \dot{\gamma}\rangle'$. Rather than using the usual basis for the tangent space, let us use an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors of $\mathcal{W}_{p,S}$. Why does such a basis always exist, even if the principle curvatures are not distinct? Prove that
